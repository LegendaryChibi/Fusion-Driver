# Fusion Driver
## Summary

Fusion driver is an endless driving game where the player drives a car to avoid enemies falling down the screen, collecting power-ups along the way to achieve a new highscore.

## Basic System

This project was made in Python using the Pygame API. It contains a basic 2D layout of a car driving in space, avoiding enemies as they drop down lanes towards the player. The car's position is vertically fixed on screen and can only move left and right. 

The player drives until they achieve a highschore with three different types of power ups to aid them, a heart for health, a lightning bolt for speed, and a shield for temporary invincibility

## Purpose

This game is meant to display an understanding of object oriented principals at the simplest level. This is a project that I spent a lot of time working on when I first started learning code and is the first step I took to becoming a game developer today.
